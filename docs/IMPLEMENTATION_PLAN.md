# ytv1 Implementation Plan (Cycle B: YouTube CLI Substitute)

## Status Legend

- `[x]` done
- `[-]` in progress
- `[ ]` pending
- `[!]` blocked

---

## 0. Planning Rules (Authoritative)

1. This document is the single execution order for active work.
2. Do not start tasks outside this file unless user explicitly requests.
3. Execute sequentially by dependency track (`B0 -> B9`).
4. Before substantial coding:
   - mark active track as `[-]`
   - keep all later tracks as `[ ]`
5. After substantial coding:
   - mark completed track `[x]`
   - move next track to `[-]` if continuing
   - update `Current Snapshot`
6. Keep package-first architecture; CLI remains adapter-only.
7. Keep public API stable unless a track explicitly declares additive extension.
8. Merge-ready gate per track:
   - `go test ./...` green
   - new behavior covered by tests or explicit TODO with reason
   - no hidden hardcoded runtime behavior without config/fallback

---

## 1. Current Snapshot (Update Every Session)

### 1.1 Session Date
- `2026-02-16`

### 1.2 Completed Baseline (Cycle A Closed)
- Previous migration cycle `R0-R11` is fully completed.
- DSYF runtime gate already passed end-to-end (`extract + download + merge`).
- Live-gated E2E tests and default test suite were green at cycle closeout.
- Core parity blocks are in place: Innertube policy, JS challenge, POT policy/injection, format materialization, retryable downloader transport, CLI diagnostics.

### 1.3 Current Gap Theme (New Cycle Focus)
- CLI still supports only a narrow selector mapping (`best`, `bestaudio`, `bestvideo`, `mp4`, `mp3`) and lacks yt-dlp-grade selection grammar behavior.
- CLI/operator workflow parity is incomplete (batch controls, archive/idempotency, richer output templating, predictable failure controls).
- Need explicit substitute-level acceptance criteria and regression matrix focused on real operator workflows, not only single-ID success.
- B0 documentation sync is complete across plan/readme/architecture with explicit scorecard targets and workflow matrix classes.
- B1 first increment landed: CLI now forwards custom `-f` expressions to package selector flow, while preserving mp3/mode aliases and numeric itag input handling.
- B1 second increment landed in selector engine: fixed `ext=m4a` matching for `audio/mp4`, added width-filter semantics, improved `best` ranking to prefer AV candidates, and added selector behavior tests for merge/fallback/filter paths.
- B1 third increment landed: added `worstvideo/worstaudio` selection semantics and standalone predicate parsing (`fps!=60`, `ext=mp4`, `height<=720`) for fallback segments.
- B1 completion increment landed: selector parse/match failures now surface as typed `ErrNoPlayableFormats` details with selector+reason diagnostics, and CLI remediation hints include selector-specific guidance.
- B2 completion increment landed: output template token rendering (`%(id)s`, `%(title)s`, `%(uploader)s`, `%(ext)s`, `%(itag)s`) now applies deterministically to single/merge downloads with filename-safe normalization and test coverage.
- B3 first increment landed: CLI now exposes batch error policy (`--abort-on-error`), resume policy (`--no-continue`), and retry controls (`--retries`, `--retry-sleep-ms`) mapped into package transport config; main-loop abort semantics are covered by command-layer tests.
- B3 completion increment landed: resume control is wired through CLI-to-download pipeline (`Resume` propagation), retry/backoff overrides are test-covered at config mapping layer, and batch continue/abort semantics are validated with deterministic processor-loop tests.
- B4 completion increment landed: playlist item processing now reports deterministic per-item outcomes with final totals (`total/succeeded/failed/aborted`) and explicit abort-on-error cutover semantics validated by command-layer tests.
- B5 completion increment landed: subtitle flags now execute end-to-end in CLI (`--write-subs`, `--write-auto-subs`, `--sub-lang`) with deterministic SRT naming/output, explicit language fallback policy wiring, and mp3-mode failure remediation hints.
- B6 completion increment landed: CLI archive-backed idempotency is now available via `--download-archive`, with deterministic skip-on-rerun policy, append-on-success persistence, and corruption-tolerant archive load behavior.
- B7 completion increment landed: CLI now emits structured JSON failure payloads in `--print-json` mode (`ok=false`, `input`, `exit_code`, `error{category,message,attempts?}`), exposes explicit exit-code-by-category policy, and uses shared package error categorization for automation-stable diagnostics.
- B8 completion increment landed: fixture workflow matrix is now codified by command-layer matrix tests (`TestWorkflowMatrix_FixtureCoverage`) with reproducible command contract (`go test ./...`, live-gated `YTV1_E2E=1 go test ./client -run TestE2E_`), and latest fixture-gated scorecard on `2026-02-16` is `workflow_pass_rate=100%`, `deterministic_output_rate=100%`, `diagnosable_failure_rate=100%` (inferred from passing matrix-class tests).
- B9 closeout verification landed: `go test ./...` and live-gated matrix (`YTV1_E2E=1 go test ./client -run TestE2E_ -count=1 -timeout 8m`) passed on `2026-02-16`, and residual risk register is now explicit with severity/owner.
- Post-closeout CLI compatibility increment landed: added yt-dlp-style short JSON flag alias (`-J`) mapped to existing `--print-json` behavior with parser test coverage.
- Post-closeout CLI compatibility gap remains for common yt-dlp operator aliases (for example `--flat-playlist` and related playlist/error-handling flags).
- B10 completion increment landed: added yt-dlp compatibility aliases (`--flat-playlist`/`--extract-flat`, `--no-playlist`/`--yes-playlist`, `--ignore-errors`/`-i`, `-j`/`--dump-json`, `--continue`) and wired deterministic flat-playlist output behavior in command flow with parser/command tests.
- B10 compatibility follow-up landed: parser now accepts yt-dlp subtitle format flag (`--sub-format` and `-sub-format`) to prevent unknown-flag failures, with regression tests.
- B10 compatibility completion follow-up landed: `--sub-format` now drives subtitle output serialization (`srt`/`vtt`) end-to-end, with transcript formatting utilities promoted into `client` package and CLI consuming package APIs.
- B10 compatibility follow-up landed: parser now accepts yt-dlp subtitle language alias `--sub-langs` (including single-dash `-sub-langs`) mapped to existing `SubLangs` behavior, with parser regression tests.
- B10 compatibility follow-up landed: parser now accepts yt-dlp subtitle write alias `--write-srt` (including `-write-srt`) and maps it to subtitle write flow while forcing `sub-format=srt`.
- B10 compatibility follow-up landed: added `--dump-single-json` mode with yt-dlp-style single-entry payload (`url`, `webpage_url`, `formats`) for tool compatibility (including mpv ytdl hook expectations).
- B10 compatibility follow-up landed: `--print-json` (`-J`, `-j`, `--dump-json`) now emits yt-dlp-style single-entry payload for external tool compatibility, while retaining shared JSON failure payload contract.
- B11 completion increment landed: `-F` format list now emits explicit `Note` labels (`audio only`/`video only`/`av`) so operators can pick direct audio formats without relying on `0x0` inference.
- B12 completion increment landed: playlist flows now suppress human stdout in JSON modes, alias reconciliation honors argument order for conflicting flags, and startup/config failures emit structured JSON diagnostics under `--print-json`.

## 2. Mission and Scope (Cycle B)

### 2.1 Mission
Make `ytv1` a practical **YouTube-focused** CLI substitute for yt-dlp in daily operator workflows, while preserving package-first architecture.

### 2.2 Scope Boundary
- In scope: YouTube extractor + downloader behavior and CLI operation parity for common yt-dlp usage patterns.
- Out of scope: Multi-site extractor parity across non-YouTube providers.

### 2.3 Non-Negotiable Outcome
- A defined workflow matrix (single video, playlist batch, format selection, subtitle path, archive/idempotent rerun) executes successfully with deterministic behavior and actionable diagnostics.

## 7. Residual Risk Register (Post-Closeout)

1. `Medium` - Upstream YouTube behavior drift may break live extraction/download without code changes.
   owner: `internal/orchestrator`, `internal/playerjs`, `internal/challenge` maintainers.
2. `Low` - CLI substitute claim is YouTube-scoped; multi-site parity is intentionally out of scope.
   owner: product scope maintainers (`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `README.md`).
3. `Low` - Live-gated confidence depends on periodic reruns; fixture matrix alone cannot detect all upstream runtime shifts.
   owner: release/checklist maintainers (`client/e2e_integration_test.go` + CI operators).
